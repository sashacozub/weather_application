## Overview

The aim of this project is to create a weather application that delivers real-time weather information for the userâ€™s desired location. It caters to travelers, hikers, photographers, event planners, and anyone needing timely weather forecasts.

## Features

- **Forecast**: Users can view a 5-day forecast to plan ahead.
- **Customization**: Users can toggle between different temperature units (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit).
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/) API
- axios
- TanStack Query

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

   ```sh
   cd your-project
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

   To insert your API key, open the .env.local file in the root directory and replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key from openweathermap.org.

### Running the Application

To run the application locally, use the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

To build the application for production, use the following command:

```sh
npm run build
```

After building the application, you can start the production server using:

```sh
npm start
```

These commands will build the optimized production bundle and start a production server to serve the application.

### Accessing the Application

After running the application locally, you should be able to access it in your web browser using the following URL: http://localhost:3000. If you encounter any issues accessing it, ensure that the server started by your IDE is running correctly.
