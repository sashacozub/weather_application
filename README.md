# Weather Application

This is a university project that is part of the Web Development subject.
<br/>

## Conceptual Design

The aim of this project is to develop a weather application that delivers real-time weather information for the user’s desired location. <br/>
The intended target user group consists of people who rely on accurate weather to plan their activities accordingly. This includes travelers, hikers, photographers, videographers, event planners, as well as any individuals who want to have a timely weather forecast for specific areas.
<br/>
The benefit of using this application is its provision of real-time and accurate weather information about user’s desired location. The application offers a clean, simple, modern and responsive interface where users can customize the location, temperature format as well as get the most important information for their current time and forecast for the week. The value of this application is that it does not overload the user with excess data, but instead presents them with the essential information needed to plan their outdoor activities or choose appropriate clothing.
